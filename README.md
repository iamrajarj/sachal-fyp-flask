# Build and run:
Open the project from this link: https://github.com/IAMIQBAL/FYP-DLSRWF on jupyter notebook
Run all the cells of the PredictApi.ipynb, and the api will be up and running

Then open this project on vscode and run deploy.py, follow the link to local host: http://127.0.0.1:5000/index and the web app will be displayed.
Go to predict option and predict the output.

Prediction for different features using different models can be done by changing the model selection on the PredictApi.ipynb notebook and updating the timestamp
